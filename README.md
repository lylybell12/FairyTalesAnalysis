## Project Overview
I produced a text mining algorithm to compare the significance of words surrounding pronouns. I approached this via text analysis on R using the
tidytext package. Sentiment value was extracted from the verbs and adjectives surrounding feminine and masculine pronouns. The frequency and the sentiment of a word was
then used to calculate sentiment severity. The word comparison between female and male pronouns were then visualized for facilitated analysis. The results demonstrate the
implication of genders roles within fictional plots.
